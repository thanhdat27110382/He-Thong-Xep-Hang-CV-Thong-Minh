## Features
- **NLP Techniques**: Implements Named Entity Recognition (NER), text classification, and semantic similarity to extract relevant information.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for effective resume ranking.
- **AIOps Integration**: Monitors system performance and detects anomalies.
- **MLOps Pipelines**: Automates model development, training, and deployment processes.
- **LLMops Application**: Enhances semantic understanding and provides personalized feedback to job seekers.

## Architecture
The system architecture consists of the following components:
1. **Resume and JD Upload**: Interface for uploading resumes and job descriptions.
2. **NLP Preprocessing**: Extracts relevant features from the input texts.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical representations (TF-IDF, embeddings).
4. **ML Model**: Ranks resumes using trained machine learning models.
5. **AIOps Monitoring**: Monitors system performance and optimizes operations.
6. **Feedback Mechanism**: Collects user feedback to improve the system.

## Usage
To run the application, follow these steps:

Start the server:
```bash
python app.py

```

-Access the application: Open your web browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000]

-Upload job descriptions and resumes to view ranked results.

## Evaluation
The systemâ€™s performance can be evaluated based on the following metrics:

-Accuracy: Measures how accurately resumes are ranked.

-Scalability: Assesses the system's ability to handle large volumes of data.

-Explainability: Provides insights into the model's ranking decisions using techniques like SHAP.



## Conclusion
The Automated Resume Ranking System leverages advanced AI technologies to facilitate a more efficient and effective hiring process, benefiting both employers and job seekers.
